# Secret Contracts


Secret Contracts are the first implementation of general purpose privacy preserving computations on public blockchain. While similar to Ethereum smart contracts in design, Secret Contracts work with encrypted data (inputs, encrypted outputs and encrypted state). These privacy guarantees are made possible by a decentralized network of validators, who run Secret Contracts execution inside Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs).

Secret Contracts are Rust based smart contracts that compile to WebAssembly. Secret Contracts, which are based on Go-CosmWasm, introduce the compute module that runs inside the TEE to enable secure data processing (inputs, outputs and contract state.
